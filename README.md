react-detector
===========

Chrome extension that detects [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/) apps as you browse.

Adds a small ReactJS icon into the address bar when you come across a page that is built using ReactJS. Clicking on the icon toggles outlines of React-generated elements.

This is a fork from [ng-detector](https://github.com/IgorMinar/ng-detector) with very few changes.
