DEPRECATED. [The official React DevTools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) can do eveything this extension can do and more. Please install that instead.

react-detector
===========

Chrome extension that detects [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/) apps as you browse.

Adds a small ReactJS icon into the address bar when you come across a page that is built using ReactJS. Clicking on the icon toggles outlines of React-generated elements.

You can also click on the icon to outline the react components on the page:

This is a fork from [ng-detector](https://github.com/IgorMinar/ng-detector) with very few changes.

# FAQ:

> Why is it not showing up for some apps anymore?

Because of [this](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-detector/issues/7#issuecomment-156707194). :-(
